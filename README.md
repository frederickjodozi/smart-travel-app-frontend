## smart-travel-app-frontend

My final project for the Practicum web development course and my first self-directed fullstack app! Very excited building this one.

The application will consist of a main page featuring a searchbar to return information about sightseeing locations from all over the world upon query. It will be possible for users to make a profile and save their favorite locations in an alternate page. 

Thanks to OpenTripMap API for making this project possible: https://opentripmap.io/product

Stay tuned for updates :)
