## *smart-travel-app-frontend: TripleTen graduation personal project!*
This project consists of *my first self-directed FullStack application*! It is a personal demonstration of all the skills I have learned from the TripleTen curriculum. I was very excited building it!

The App consists of a Main page featuring a Searchbar that returns information about sightseeing locations from all over the world upon query. It will be possible for users to make a profile and save their favorite locations in an alternate page. 

Both this part and the Backend are hosted together on a Cloud server and helped me solidify my knowledge and skills hosting applications on cloud servers. 

## *Features*
The main Features on the Frontend are as follows: 
- **React States** for user Login, locations, saved locations and popups.
- **User authorization** featuring **JWT**.
- Both a **custom userApi** and **openTripMap Api** request files.
- **Popup** Components for Registry, Login, and Location viewing.
- A **Searchbar** Component to handle location queries.
- A **Protected Route** Component to redirect unauthenticated users.
- The use of **React Context** to display user information through the page. 

## *Contributions*
This project can be cloned on a local machine for studying and/or editing, and relevant pull requests will be accepted!  

I would first like to thank TripleTen for teaching me the skills required to build this project, and also OpenTripMap API for their amazing and free-to-use database of sightseeing locations: https://opentripmap.io/product
